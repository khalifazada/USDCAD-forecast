# USDCAD-forecast

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate forecasting capabilities of our statistical model. At the core we used multivariable regression to predict next day closing price of USDCAD echange rate based on 18 explanatory variables.

This project took several weeks of intense data gathering and cleaning in a collaboration with 3 other students at UBC. As part of a coursework we had to come up with a challenging question where we had to apply skills gained in our Statistical Learning class.

The PDF file in the repository demonstrates our step-by-step procedure and ideas we generated to get to the final result. Overall model diagnostics show high predictive accuracy leaving us very satisfied with our results and findings.
